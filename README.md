# Analysis-of-PPA-Trade--off-with-Different-Standard-Cell-Architectures-for-RISC-V-Processor
This study presents a comprehensive analysis of a RISC-V processor's 
performance using different threshold voltage (VT) cells—Low VT (LVT), Standard VT 
(SVT), and High VT (HVT)—across varying design effort levels—high, medium, and 
low. The investigation encompasses power consumption, timing slack, and physical 
area considerations. Synthesis was conducted using Genus electronic design 
automation (EDA) tool of Cadence, ensuring a consistent experimental setup. Our 
results highlight the trade-offs inherent in choosing different VT cells and effort levels, 
providing valuable insights for optimizing RISC-V processor designs based on specific 
application requirements. The findings contribute to the understanding of the 
interplay between power, timing, and area in semiconductor design, aiding designers 
in making informed decisions for efficient and tailored processor implementations.
